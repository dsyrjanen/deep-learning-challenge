# deep-learning-challenge

I attempted a few adjustments to optimize the model and get above 75%, but couldn't get it much higher than 74%. I tried to adjust the number of hidden layers from 2 to 3 to 4 and also adjusted the number of neurons in each layer in each attempt. The initial model maxed out at 73%, so it was a slight increase but didn't get to 75%.



Some coding was done with assistance from the Instructor.
